    "# Python Logging  \n",
    "\n",
    "❑ Introduction to Python Logging: Python's logging module provides a built-in way to handle logging, allowing developers to track events, errors, and operational details efficiently.  \n",
    "❑ Configuring Logging: The logging module can be configured using basicConfig() to set the format, level, and output destination of logs.  \n",
    "❑ Log Levels: Python logging provides five levels of severity: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, each serving a specific purpose.  \n",
    "❑ Logging to Files: Logs can be directed to files using logging.FileHandler, ensuring persistent storage of logs for debugging and monitoring.  \n",
    "❑ Using Loggers, Handlers, and Formatters: The Logger object is used to create logs, Handlers define where logs go (console, file, etc.), and Formatters define log message structure.  \n",
    "❑ Exception Logging: Using logger.exception() inside try-except blocks captures and logs stack traces when an exception occurs.  \n",
    "❑ Best Practices: Use log levels appropriately, avoid excessive logging, configure logs centrally, use timestamps, and ensure sensitive information is not logged.  "
