    "We use `fit_transform()` on the training data because we want the scaler to learn the **mean and standard deviation** only from the **training set**. This captures the **distribution** that the model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we use `transform()` on the test data to apply the **same scaling** (using the training set's stats) â€” this ensures that the test data is brought to the same scale **without leaking information** from the test set into the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting the scaler again on the test set would **expose the model to unseen data**, leading to **data leakage** and **unreliable evaluation results**."
